# Cognifyz-Python-Internship
Hi, I'm Deepika! ðŸ‘‹  
This repository contains all the Python tasks I completed during my internship at *Cognifyz Technologies* under the role of *Python Developer Intern*. 
These tasks cover both beginner and intermediate levels, focusing on real-world logic, coding fundamentals, and file handling.


##  Level 1 Tasks

### âœ… Task 1: Calculator
A basic calculator program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input.

### âœ… Task 2: Temperature Converter
Converts temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

### âœ… Task 3: Email Validator
Validates email addresses using basic string pattern checks to ensure correct formatting.

### âœ… Task 4: Word Counter
Takes a string input from the user and counts the frequency of each word using a dictionary.

### âœ… Task 5: Palindrome Checker
Checks if a word or sentence is a palindrome (ignoring spaces and case sensitivity).


##  Level 2 Tasks

### âœ… Task 1: Number Guessing Game (1â€“100)
Generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user keeps guessing until they find the correct number, with hints provided.

### âœ… Task 2: Number Guesser (Custom Range)
Enhanced guessing game that allows the user to define a custom start and end range.

### âœ… Task 3: Password Strength Checker
Analyzes a password and determines its strength (Weak, Moderate, Strong) using regular expressions.

### âœ… Task 4: Word Count from File (sample.txt)
Reads content from a .txt file, processes it, and counts word frequency. Punctuation is removed and words are sorted alphabetically.

### âœ… Task 5: File Line Reader
Reads each line of a file and prints it with formatting and line numbers.

## Key Learnings
- Python functions, conditionals, loops, and input handling
- Working with files (.txt) â€“ reading, writing, and analyzing
- Using regular expressions for validation
- Structuring Python scripts for clarity and reuse
